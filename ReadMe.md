# Kanban Board

A basic Kanban board, initially made using pure html and vanilla JavaScript, users can currently:

- Make a custom column
- Create uniquely IDed cards in each column
- Delete cards
- Drag and drop cards between all columns
- Delete columns
- Create custom named cards

## Features in progress:

- Editing cards
- Local storage

## Aims

Eventually this project will be integrated with Firebase allowing for authenticated users to have their own spaces and write access to other users spaces.
